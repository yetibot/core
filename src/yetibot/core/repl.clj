     Hello.

     The Yetibot dev REPL is intended to be used during interactive development
     as is commonly practiced in the Clojure community (see
     https://clojure.org/guides/repl/introduction if you want to learn more
     about interactive development with a REPL).

     Here are a few commands it provides:

     (start) - run Yetibot with your config and a small subset of core commands.
     (reset) - useful during dev to reload and restart Yetibot
     (stop) - stop Yetibot - can be useful e.g. to free up the webserver port
     (load-all) - load everything instead of the subset of Yetibot
