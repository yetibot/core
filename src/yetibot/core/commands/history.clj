;; `history` can look ahead at next command to see if there's a head/tail, count

(defn history-cmd
  "history # show chat history

   By default all history except for `history` commands are not included, since
   they make it too easy for a history command to query itself.

   To include them, use:

   -h --include-history-commands

   To further specify which types of history is excluded use any combination of
   these options:

   -y --exclude-yetibot - excludes yetibot responses
   -e --exclude-commands - excludes command requests by users
   -n --exclude-non-commands - excludes normal chat by users

   For example, to only fetch Yetibot responses:

   history -cn

   To only fetch commands:

   history -ny

   To only fetch Yetibot history:

   history -ne

   By default history will only fetch history for the channel that it was
   requested from, but it can also fetch history across all channels within an
   adapter by specifying:

   -a --include-all-channels

   You can also specify a channel or channels (comma separated):

   -c --channels

   For example:

   history -c #general,#random

   Search history from a specific user or users (comma separated):

   -u --user

   For example:

   history -u devth

   Search within a specific date range:

   -s --since <date>
   -v --until <date>

   Note: <date> can be specified in a variety of formats by using the `date`
   command, e.g.:

   history --since `date last month`
   history --since `date summer solstice`

   See `help date` for more examples.

   history can be combined with pipes as usual, but it has special support for a
   few collection commands where it will bake the expression into a single SQL
   query instead of trying to naively evaluate in memory:

   history | grep <query> - uses Postgres' ~ operator to search
   history | tail [<n>] - uses LIMIT n and ORDER_BY
   history | head [<n>] - uses LIMIT n and ORDER_BY
   history | random - uses LIMIT 1 Postgres' ORDER_BY random()
   history | count - uses COUNT(*)"
