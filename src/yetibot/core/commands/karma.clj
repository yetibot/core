  "The Karma feature is presently only available for use in Slack.

   Slack delivers reaction events by shortcode (actually a slightly modified
   string version). Without an exhaustive mapping there's no reliable way for
   us to support configrable emoji reaction processing in Slack, which we have
   prioritized. Unfortunately, this breaks IRC, where response emoji are then
   rendered as the shortcode string instead of the character. We hope to
   improve this in the future.

   Support has not yet been added to Mattermost, though it could support it."
