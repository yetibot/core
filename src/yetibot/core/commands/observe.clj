   When a match occurs the <cmd> will be executed. <cmd> may contain a piped

     `{{channel}}` - the channel that the observer triggered in
     `{{username}}` - the username of the user that triggered the observer
     `{{body}}` - the body of the message that triggered the observer

   Only applies to `react` observer types:

     `{{reaction}}` - the reaction e.g. :rage:
     `{{message-username}}` - username that originally posted the messsage

   [event-type] is optional. If omitted, it will default to `message`.
   Valid event types are: `message`, `leave`, `enter`, `sound`, `kick`, `react`.

   [user-pattern] is an optional regex pattern. When specified, it creates an
   observer that only fires for a specific user or users that match the pattern.

   [channel-pattern] is an optional regex pattern. When specified it creates an
   observer that only fires for matching channel names.

   Examples:

   1. Generate a meme when appropriate
   !observe y.?u.?no = meme y u no:

   2. Lookup the temperature any time someone mentions something that looks like
   a zip code:
   !observe \\b\\d{5}\\b = \"weather | head 2 | tail\"

   3. Generate a rage meme with the body of the message any time someone reacts
   with a rage reaction (Slack only):
   !observe -e react rage = meme rage: {{body}}
