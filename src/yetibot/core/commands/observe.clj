   When a match occurs, it'll be passed via normal pipe-semantics to <cmd>, e.g.
   echo <matched-text> | <cmd>. <cmd> may contain a piped expression, but it
   must be quoted.

   Template variables are available in the <cmd> RHS:

     {{channel}} - the channel that the observer triggered in
     {{username}} - the username of the user that triggered the observer

   [event-type] is optional. If omitted, it will default to `message`. Valid
   event types are: `message`, `leave`, `enter`, `sound`, `kick`.

   [user-pattern] is an optional regex pattern. When specified, it creates an
   observer that only fires for a specific user or users that match the pattern.

   [channel-pattern] is an optional regex pattern. When specified it creates an
   observer that only fires for matching channel names.

   Examples:
   1. Generate a meme when appropriate
   !observe y.?u.?no = meme y u no:

   2. Lookup the temperature any time someone mentions something that looks like
   a zip code: !observe \\b\\d{5}\\b = \"weather | head 2 | tail\"

   Observers can be easily abused. Use them with caution & restraint 🙏."
