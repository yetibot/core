   For example:

     0 0 6 6 9 * 2010
     | | | | | |   |
     | | | | | |   +- 2010 only.
     | | | | | +----- any day of the week.
     | | | | +------- 9th month (September).
     | | | +--------- 6th day of the month.
     | | +----------- 6th hour of the day.
     | +------------- Top of the hour (minutes = 0).
     +--------------- Top of the minute (seconds = 0).

   Note: this is more expressive than standard cron which only supports 5
   arguments (lacking second and year).
